# Synapse Nexus: Multi-Agent AI for Intelligent Systems

## Overview

**Synapse Nexus** is a cutting-edge multi-agent AI framework that combines reinforcement learning, generative models, and natural language processing. It enables agents to collaborate and solve complex decision-making tasks in dynamic environments.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Train RL agents to collaborate or compete in custom environments.
- **Generative Models**: Simulate diverse scenarios with GANs for robust agent training.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Enable agents to communicate using transformer-based NLP models.
- **Intelligent Search**: Leverage optimization techniques like MCTS and Genetic Algorithms.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Visualize performance with interactive dashboards.

## Project Goals

- Build a flexible framework for multi-agent learning and decision-making.
- Solve real-world problems like traffic optimization, resource allocation, and logistics.
- Showcase versatility in both research and practical applications.

## Technologies

- **Programming**: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Libraries**: Stable-Baselines3, Hugging Face Transformers, SciPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Dash, Plotly
- **Distributed Systems**: Docker, RabbitMQ
